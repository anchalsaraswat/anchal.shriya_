            <h4><font size="5"> Food</font></h4>
            
            <p><font size="4">Los Angeles is home to so much good food that even year-round residents can’t consume it all. Those looking for fine dining may try Providence, helmed by Chef Michael Cimarusti, Beverly Hills’ Spago or Santa Monica’s Mélisse. For more modern spots, there’s Hot Hot Food, which specializes in numerous types of fried rice, Silver Lake Thai favorite Same Same, or Echo Park’s elegant Winsome. There’s also all of Thai Town, where people hail Jitlada as the champion of spice. Trendy outposts such as Salazar in Silver Lake (the shrimp quesadilla is amazing) or roadside carts or hidden backyard gems such as Dona Mary in Watts serve up excellent Mexican fare.These are just some examples of the food you get to eat. New restaurants are opening up every week, meaning the scene is constantly evolving—just like your palate.</font></p>
